# **Ruth Nasejje**  
**Data Science Sophomore** | 📍 **Storrs, CT** | 🎓 **University of Connecticut**

Hi! I’m Ruth Nasejje, a Data Science major with a concentration in Financial Analysis at the University of Connecticut. I have a deep passion for finance, statistics, and consulting, and I love using data-driven insights to solve complex problems. My goal is to bridge data science with risk management and financial analysis, creating smart solutions for businesses. I thrive at the intersection of technology, strategy, and leadership—whether that’s through machine learning, data visualization, or problem-solving. Beyond academics, I’m an advocate for expanding Black representation in unfamiliar spaces and building a strong community through faith and service.
